TFregulomeR-dev

v2.0.2 

changed to Canada server as default (Singapore server retired) compared to v2.0.1 (updated on April 17, 2022)


New features: 
1. Link to data compendium hosted in Singapore and Canada;
2. Link to TF motifs and DNA methylation in human and mouse;
3. Perform TF interactome analysis coupled with DNA methylation and other chromatin signals such as chromatin accessibility.
4. Fixed warnings in plotLogo function in accordance with new ggplot2 package.

# Introduction
*TFregulomeR* comprises of a comprehensive compendium of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) derived from the MethMotif and GTRD, as well as the ready-to-use functionality in R language facilitating data access, integration and analysis. The binding motifs predicted in-silico from MethMotif and GTRD describe cell specific transcription factor (TF) binding propensities, while the DNA methylation profiles from MethMotif portray a second epigenetic dimension in TF binding events. The whole toolbox allows a better understanding of the TF binding propensities in a cell-specific manner.

## Current Functionalities v2.0.2
### Click [here](./inst/update_notes/functionality_update.md) for functionality update notes 

_Currently, TFregulomeR links to data compendium hosted in Canada (default). Singapore server is not more accessible. For Canada one, please use `server='ca'`. For example, when browsing TFregulomeR data compendium hosted in Canada, using `dataBrowser(server='ca')`._

Note: new function is highlighted in bold font.

1) Browse the TFregulomeR data compendium (dataBrowser())
2) Load TF peaks (loadPeaks())
3) Search motif matrix and DNA methylation score matrix (searchMotif())
4) Plot motif or MethMotif logo (plotLogo)
5) Export motif matrix and DNA methylation score matrix (exportMMPFM)
6) Get context-independent peaks along with DNA methylation profiles (commonPeaks() & commonPeakResult())
7) Get context-dependent peaks along with DNA methylation profiles (exclusivePeaks() & exclusivePeakResult())
8) Form a intersected matrix between two lists of peak sets along with DNA methylation profiles, read enrichments and **users' input external signals**, for interactome and co-binding partner studies (intersectPeakMatrix() & intersectPeakMatrixResult()). **- NEW Feature**
9) Automatically generate a PDF report for TF co-factors along with motif sequences, DNA methylation (within motif and in 200bp regions) and read enrichments (cofactorReport()).
10) **Automatically produce a dynamic three-dimensional interface showing TF interactome coupled with DNA methylation and/or users’ input external signal values (interactome3D()). - NEW Function**
11) Plot the TFBS distribution in a given list of peak sets (motifDistrib() & plotDistrib()).
12) Annotate peak genomic locations (genomeAnnotate()).
13) Annotate ontologies of target genes by a peak set (greatAnnotate()).
14) Convert a motif matrix to a PFMatrix calss object for *TFBSTools* package (toTFBSTools()).

## Installation

#### Prerequisite pakcages

1) Required packages: the packages below are the basic prerequisite packages for *TFregulomeR* functionalities

    - [jsonlite](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/index.html) (>= 1.5)
    - [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html) (>= 3.0.0)
    - [ggseqlogo](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggseqlogo/index.html) (>= 0.1)
